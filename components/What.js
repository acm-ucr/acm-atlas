					Every quarter, we focus on improving specific aspects of our
					members. In the Fall, we develop professional resumes, build
					all-star LinkedIns, and offer workshops on Applying
					Effectively at companies from the Big 4 to startups. In the
					Winter, we introduce technical pathways ranging from web/app
					development to security to cloud computing. In the Spring,
					we focus on all the small engineering cruft that is expected
					knowledge for CS students that classes don&apos;t cover:
					Offline Editing, Source Control, Using APIs, and more.
