					We want UCR to become a premier institution for Computer
					Science and Engineering. University courses provide a good
					foundation, but we strive to build upon that. So we
					supplement the curriculum with workshops tailored to our
					members and their goals. We do this through an amazing 1:1
					Mentor program, and constant feedback from our members. But
					more importantly, we want our members to make a positive
					difference in the world through software. The success of ACM
					at UCR can only be measured by the success of our members.
