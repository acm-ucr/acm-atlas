			"Every quarter, we focus on improving specific aspects of our members. In the Fall, we develop professional resumes, build all-star LinkedIns, and offer workshops on Applying Effectively at companies from the Big 4 to startups. In the Winter, we introduce technical pathways ranging from web/app development to security to cloud computing. In the Spring, we focus on all the small engineering cruft that is expected knowledge for CS students that classes don't cover: Offline Editing, Source Control, Using APIs, and more."
